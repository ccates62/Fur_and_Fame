# 🎨 Printful Integration - Quick Checklist

## ✅ Step-by-Step Checklist

### 1. API Key Setup (5 minutes)
- [ ] Go to [Printful Dashboard](https://www.printful.com/dashboard) → Stores → API
- [ ] Generate/Copy API key
- [ ] Add to `.env.local`: `PRINTFUL_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- [ ] Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

### 2. Set Up Products in Printful (15-30 minutes)
- [ ] Go to Dashboard → Product Templates
- [ ] Add Canvas 12x12 → Note Product ID and Variant ID
- [ ] Add Canvas 16x20 → Note Product ID and Variant ID
- [ ] Add Mug (11oz) → Note Product ID and Variant ID
- [ ] Add other products as needed (T-Shirt, Blanket, Poster)

**How to find IDs:**
- Check product URL: `https://www.printful.com/dashboard/products/PRODUCT_ID`
- Or use browser console/network tab when viewing variants

### 3. Update Code Mapping (5 minutes)
- [ ] Open `src/lib/printful-client.ts`
- [ ] Find `PRINTFUL_PRODUCT_MAP` (line ~12)
- [ ] Replace placeholder IDs with your actual IDs:

```typescript
"canvas-12x12": {
  productId: YOUR_ACTUAL_ID,  // ← Replace this
  variantId: YOUR_ACTUAL_ID,  // ← Replace this
},
```

### 4. Test Mockups (5 minutes)
- [ ] Go to `/checkout` page
- [ ] Select a product and variant
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify mockup images load

### 5. Test Order Creation (10 minutes)
- [ ] Make a test purchase (use Stripe test mode)
