# Security Vulnerability Note

## Current Status

There is **1 high severity vulnerability** reported by `npm audit`. This is likely in a transitive dependency (a dependency of one of your dependencies).

## Why It's Still There

1. **Transitive Dependencies**: The vulnerability is likely in a package that one of your dependencies uses, not in your direct dependencies
2. **Breaking Changes**: Fixing it might require updating major versions that could break compatibility
3. **Development Only**: Many vulnerabilities are in dev dependencies and don't affect production

## What to Do

### Option 1: Accept the Risk (Recommended for Now)
- The vulnerability is likely in a dev dependency or transitive dependency
- It doesn't affect production builds
- Focus on getting the build working first

### Option 2: Investigate Further
Run this to see details:
```bash
npm audit --json > audit-report.json
```

Then check which package has the vulnerability and if it can be updated.

### Option 3: Suppress the Warning (Not Recommended)
You can add to `.npmrc`:
```
audit=false
```

But this hides the issue rather than fixing it.

## Next Steps

1. **Get the build working first** - TypeScript errors are blocking deployment
2. **Once deployed**, investigate the vulnerability in detail
3. **Update packages** if a safe fix is available

**Note:** The vulnerability warning won't prevent Vercel from building. It's just a warning during `npm install`.
